Telosian is an open foundation dedicated to fostering resilience, independence, and connection. Our projects range from applications that filter and refine information to mental health initiatives and support for off-grid, independent lifestyles. 

We seek to create a network of resources, tools, and communities that empower individuals to connect more deeply with themselves, each other, and the natural world. We envision a future where technology supports freedom and understanding rather than overwhelm, and where people can reconnect with a sense of purpose that transcends their daily lives. 

Telosian is about creating lasting systems that others can freely adopt, adapt, and expand. We operate on open-source principles, inviting individuals from all backgrounds and disciplines to contribute, replicate, and evolve Telosian’s mission in their own unique ways. 

We believe we can build a resilient, connected world, with pathways for personal and societal transformation.
